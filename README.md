# Pre-rendered Soundfonts for Midi.js

My partner [Scott](https://github.com/szrharrison) and I at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) in NYC created a [React-based Midi Sequencer](https://github.com/szrharrison/piano-roll) that uses midi.js and the only pre-converted Soundfonts we could find were these two by [gleitz here on github](https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts). We decided to use the available generator to convert some additional Soundfont libraries into this pre-rendered format and wanted to make them available for others to use.

### Compifont_NEW.sf2 converted to JS, mp3, and ogg for midi.js
Found [here on musescore.org](https://musescore.org/en/node/94941), this soundfont was compiled by By Richard Roma
